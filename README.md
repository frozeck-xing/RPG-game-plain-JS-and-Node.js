A simple text-based RPG made in JavaScript and Node.js, intended to de-rusted myself and generate a base project with the idea of migrate it to Web later.

Instructions to run in local:
1. Clone the master branch
2. Navigate in your terminal to the file location.
3. Execute ```node main.js```
4. Enjoy!!
